## Appendix

Any additional information goes here

Selected software design pattern
is MVVM

MVVM architecture is a Model-View-ViewModel architecture that removes the tight coupling between each component. 
Most importantly, in this architecture, the children don't have the direct reference to the parent, they only have the reference by observables.
